# ICS Project Step 4
This is a small snippet of the full app, I reduced it to only the necessities so you wouldn't have to read through hundreds of lines of code.

# Back-end
The logic that interacts with the MYSQL database is in index.js and route.js. The database configuration and the actual query are living in route.js.

# Front-end
The front-end is in the "build" folder, it is html, css, and js, but it won't be very readable because it is transpiled from the source code in the "src" folder. If you want to see the front-end code, it can be located in the "src" folder.
